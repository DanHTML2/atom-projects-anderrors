      <h1>My HTML introduction</h1>
        <font col="30px" row="30">Hi my name is Daniel and I am a professional coder.
          Some of the programming languages I use is <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS </strong>because I like
          the simple layout of it. I both enjoy these two because
          they are both very easy to communicate with and learn to. My favorite is CSS because
          there are many different kinds of styles and colors to edit your html and attributes.
          I reccomened this programming language a lot because it has good features for different
          people. I also not this do coding I do mostly share codes on github like</font>

              <h2>Plans & challenges throughout my Life</h2>
                <i>Throught my life, I like to express it in several ways. Some of the things I challenge
                is living with big family. Almost 20 people every week always ask me
              if my brother julian is really my brother. Well accorse yes, as me and
            julian grew up we would always like to dance around a poop all over the place
          I even had pictures. Eversense I grew up my pears, a whole bunch of people asked me why.
        Well me and julian are futernal twins. Futernal twins make us a big part. It is
      almost like living with different personalities. Which it is. Fertinal twins are
    twins that are almost equally apart from each other. My brother has black hair
  and my own hair is blonde. Wow what a difference. Cant you believe two twins can
have different perosnalities and opposite genetics. That is one of them. Living with my brother
is fun, we both like to ride bikes at my friends houses and around my neighborhood. It is sure really fun
living with anyone not fact. But I <strong>STILL</strong> him no matter what.</i>
